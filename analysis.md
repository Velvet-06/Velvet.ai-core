# Velvet.ai-core Worker Resource Analysis

## Codebase Overview

Based on the project structure, this appears to be a background worker system that:
- Uses Redis for task queuing and coordination
- Implements worker health checks
- Runs background agent processes
- Likely handles LLM (Large Language Model) operations

## Memory & CPU Footprint Analysis

### Key Components That Impact Resource Usage:

1. **Redis Client Operations**
   - Redis connections and connection pooling
   - Message queuing and processing
   - Persistent connections for real-time operations

2. **Background Agent Processing**
   - Likely involves LLM model loading/initialization
   - Async task processing and queue management
   - Potential model inference operations

3. **Worker Health Monitoring**
   - Continuous health check processes
   - Monitoring and reporting mechanisms

### Memory-Intensive Operations Expected:

1. **LLM Model Loading**: Modern language models typically require:
   - 100MB - 2GB+ for model weights (depending on model size)
   - Additional memory for tokenization and inference
   - Memory buffers for processing requests

2. **Redis Operations**:
   - Connection pools: ~10-50MB
   - Message buffering and queue management
   - Async operation overhead

3. **Python Runtime**:
   - Base Python interpreter: ~20-30MB
   - Dependencies (asyncio, Redis client, ML libraries): ~50-200MB
   - Application code and data structures: ~50-100MB

4. **Background Processing**:
   - Concurrent task handling
   - Memory for intermediate processing results
   - Queue management overhead

## Instance Type Recommendation

### ❌ Starter ($7/mo) - 512MB RAM, 0.5 CPU
**NOT RECOMMENDED** - Insufficient for this workload because:
- Already failed with "Ran out of memory (used over 512MB)"
- LLM operations alone can consume 200-500MB+
- No headroom for Redis operations and Python runtime
- 0.5 CPU insufficient for concurrent background processing

### ✅ Standard ($25/mo) - 2GB RAM, 1 CPU  
**RECOMMENDED MINIMUM** - Suitable because:
- 2GB RAM provides adequate headroom for:
  - LLM model loading and inference (up to 1GB)
  - Redis operations and connection pooling (100-200MB)
  - Python runtime and dependencies (200-300MB)
  - Operating system and buffer space (400-500MB)
- 1 CPU sufficient for background worker operations
- Cost-effective for production deployment

### 🚀 Pro ($85/mo) - 4GB RAM, 2 CPU
**RECOMMENDED FOR SCALE** - Consider if:
- Using larger LLM models (>1GB)
- High-throughput processing requirements
- Multiple concurrent agent operations
- Need for performance optimization

## Final Recommendation

**Start with Standard ($25/mo)** for the following reasons:

1. **Proven Capacity**: 2GB RAM is 4x the failed 512MB limit
2. **LLM Compatibility**: Supports most standard language models
3. **Redis Overhead**: Adequate space for queue management
4. **Growth Headroom**: Room for optimization and minor scaling
5. **Cost Efficiency**: Reasonable cost for production deployment

## Migration Notes

- Monitor memory usage after deployment
- Set up alerts for memory consumption >80%
- Consider upgrading to Pro if processing demands increase
- Implement memory optimization in code where possible

## Cost Summary
- **Recommended**: Standard Worker - $25/month
- **Alternative**: Pro Worker - $85/month (if high performance needed)
- **Avoid**: Starter Worker - $7/month (insufficient resources)
